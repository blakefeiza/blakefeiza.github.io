Thank you for visiting my personal portfolio. My name is Blake and I am a Data Scientist at Nielsen Media, based in the Chicago office and residing in the Austin, TX area.
I work in the audience measurement sector of Nielsen, focusing on Big Data in National and predictive demographic modelling for households and individuals.

At Nielsen, we use television provider tuning data alongside our gold standard Nielsen TV Panel to understand consumer behavior, and project that to represent a larger group of people.
I am responsible for maintaining data pipelines, projecting machine-learning models, and crafting innovative solutions to requests related to the advancement of audience measurement.
Data validation for multi-billion row DataFrames in PySpark in addition to running non-production directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) in Apache Airflow, and code 
development in Python and SQL encompass my day-to-day at a high level.

I graduated from Florida Gulf Coast University (FGCU) with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and concentration in Statistics (3.9 GPA) in 2021. As an undergraduate student,
I had the opportunity to conduct research projects on a player efficiency model for esports and objective functions to rank majors for incoming students depending on their
individual emphasis on salary importance and percent meaning of life in their profession.
